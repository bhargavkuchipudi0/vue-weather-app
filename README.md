# Weather APP | üå° ‚òÅ | Vue.js

Thank you for checking out this repo. I have started this project to learn Vue.js. 
I am using some third part free weather API's in this project. I also wanted to do
this project with out asking for any location permissions. In order to achieve I used
a 3rd party API which gives my geolocation like lat, lon, city, Region etc.,

# 3rd Party API's
     - OpenWeather (https://openweathermap.org/)
     - IpInfo (https://ipinfo.io)


# Vue Things:

    - Data Binding
    - Parent child communication
    - service files (API calls)
    - Vuex (Global Store)
